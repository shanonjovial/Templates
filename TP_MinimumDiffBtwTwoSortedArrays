### Given two arrays sorted in ascending order, find the absolute minimum difference between any pair of elements |a-b| such that a is from one array and b is from another array.

import sys
def printClosest(ar1, ar2):
    m = len(ar1)
    n = len(ar2)

    diff = sys.maxsize
    
    p1 = 0
    p2 = 0
    
    while (p1 < m and p2 < n):
        if abs(ar1[p1] - ar2[p2]) < diff:
            diff = abs(ar1[p1] - ar2[p2])
        
        if (ar1[p1] > ar2[p2]):
            p2 += 1
        else:
            p1 += 1

    return diff
