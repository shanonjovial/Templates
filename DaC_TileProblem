#### Given a n by n board where n is of form 2k where k >= 1 (Basically n is a power of 2 with minimum value as 2). The board has one missing cell (of size 1 x 1). Fill the board using L shaped tiles. A L shaped tile is a 2 x 2 square with one cell of size 1Ã—1 missing.

### ** Solution **
## // n is size of given square, p is location of missing cell Tile(int n, Point p)
## 1) Base case: n = 2, A 2 x 2 square with one cell missing is nothing but a tile and can be filled with a single tile.
## 2) Place a L shaped tile at the center such that it does not cover the n/2 * n/2 subsquare that has a missing square. Now all four subsquares of size n/2 x n/2 have a missing cell (a cell that doesn't need to be filled). See figure 2 below.
## 3) Solve the problem recursively for following four. Let p1, p2, p3 and p4 be positions of the 4 missing cells in 4 squares.
##   a) Tile(n/2, p1)
##   b) Tile(n/2, p2)
##   c) Tile(n/2, p3)
##   d) Tile(n/2, p3) 
## ** After placing first tile **
## ** Recurring for first subsquare **
## ** Shows first step in all four subsquares **
