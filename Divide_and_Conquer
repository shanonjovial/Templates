## ** 我们已经见过的Divide and Conquer相关的问题：**

#- Binary Search
#- Merge Sort
#- Quick Sort

# The divide-and-conquer strategy solves a problem by:
# 1. Breaking it into subproblems that are themselves smaller instances of the same type of problem
# 2. Recursively solving these subproblems
# 3. Appropriately combining their answers

# The real work is done piecemeal, in three different places: in the partitioning of problems into subproblems; at the very tail end of the recursion, when the subproblems are so small that they are solved outright; and in the gluing together of partial answers. These are held together and coordinated by the algorithm’s core recursive structure.
