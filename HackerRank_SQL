####### TOP COMPETITORS ##########
## Julia just finished conducting a coding contest, and she needs your help assembling the leaderboard! Write a query to print the respective hacker_id and name of hackers who achieved full scores for more than one challenge. Order your output in descending order by the total number of challenges in which the hacker earned a full score. If more than one hacker received full scores in same number of challenges, then sort them by ascending hacker_id.

######## Ollivander's Inventory ##########
## Harry Potter and his friends are at Ollivander's with Ron, finally replacing Charlie's old broken wand.
## Hermione decides the best way to choose is by determining the minimum number of gold galleons needed to buy each non-evil wand of high power and age. Write a query to print the id, age, coins_needed, and power of the wands that Ron's interested in, sorted in order of descending power. If more than one wand has same power, sort the result in order of descending age.

########### Challenge ###############
## Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student. Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, then exclude those students from the result.

######### CONTEST LEADERBOARD ##########
## You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!

## The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges.

If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of  from your result.

##################### 15 DAYS OF LEARNING SQL ##########################
## Julia conducted a  days of learning SQL contest. The start date of the contest was March 01, 2016 and the end date was March 15, 2016.

## Write a query to print total number of unique hackers who made at least  submission each day (starting on the first day of the contest), and find the hacker_id and name of the hacker who made maximum number of submissions each day. If more than one such hacker has a maximum number of submissions, print the lowest hacker_id. The query should print this information for each day of the contest, sorted by the date.
