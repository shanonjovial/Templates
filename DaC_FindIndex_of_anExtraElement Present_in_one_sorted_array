###### Given two sorted arrays. 
## There is only 1 difference between the arrays. First array has one element extra added in between. 
## Find the *index* of the extra element.
## Examples:
## Input : {2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12};
##       {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12};
## Output : 4
## The first array has an extra element 9.
## The extra element is present at index 4.
## Input :  {3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13}
##         {3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
## Output :  3

##### OPTION 1 #####
## Returns index of extra element in arr1[].
def find_extra(arr1, arr2):
    for i in range(len(arr2)):
        if (arr1[i] != arr2[i]):
            return i
 
    return len(arr1)-1

##### OPTION 2 #####
def find_extra_fast(arr1, arr2):
    index = len(arr2)
    # left and right are end points denoting the current range.
    left, right = 0, len(arr2) - 1
    while (left <= right):
        mid = (left + right) // 2;
 
        # If middle element is same of both arrays, it means that extra element is after mid so we update left to mid+1
        if (arr2[mid] == arr1[mid]):
            left = mid + 1
 
        # If middle element is different of the arrays, it means that the index we are searching for is either mid, or before mid. Hence we update right to mid-1.
        else:
            index = mid
            right = mid - 1;
 
    # when right is greater than left our search is complete.
    return index
